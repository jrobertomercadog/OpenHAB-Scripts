This repository is my Collection of scripts used for OpenHAB (or any other purpose).  
They will most likely use MQTT as a transport, and therfore will be quite generic.  

They are intended for use on remote devices (raspberry PI for example) for sending sensor information  or responding to commands.

jrobertomercadog Notes:
* This forked repository focuses on the Bluemaestro Bluetooth Temp thingamagick.
* Please check the README.md at the "BlueTooth" directory for more details!
